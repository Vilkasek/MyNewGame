# Zombie survivalist

## About game core

### Concept

Concept for this game is very old, but with little twist. Normally you are a survivalist trying to survive in a world with zombies trying to eat you. In my game roles are swapped... Humans have weapons, have brains and you (a zombie) must survive in human's world. This is my first game, so I must make this game smaller than I planned. Instead of open world this will be a game with a set of locations and a base as your hub.

### Core mechanics

First core mechanic is eating humans to quench your hunger and heal yourself.

Second is evolving: while you are eating people, you gain experience points. After leveling up you can unclock new mutations.

Third is building your base.

Fourth is going to small locations, because to build your base and evolve you need to gather resources and eat people.

### Story

For now I didn't think about it. I'm focused on making good mechanics. After that I'll make good plot.

## About world

### Locations

The world will be divided into small instances. On each map you can find people, buildings and some resources for building your base and improving your gear (maybe, I'm not sure about this idea).

On each level you must find as much resources as you can and eat as many people as you need. But you have to watch your time. After some time an army will detect you and send commandos (I'm not sure about this idea).
