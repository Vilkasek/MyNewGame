# Zombie survivalist

## About my game

### Concept

Concept for this game is very old, but with little twist. Normally you are survivalist who trying survive in world with zombies, who try eat you. In my game roles are swapped... Humans have got weapons, have got brains and you (zombie) must survive in human's world.

### Core mechanics

First core mechanic is eating humans for repleinish your hunger and heal yourself.
Second is evolving, while you eating people you gain experience points, after level up you can unclock new mutations.
Third is building your base.

### Story

I didn't for now thinking about it so for now I focus on make good mechanics. After that I'll make good plot.
