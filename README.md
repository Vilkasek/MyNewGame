# Zombie survivalist

## About game core

### Concept

Concept for this game is very old, but with little twist. Normally you are survivalist who trying survive in world with zombies, who try eat you. In my game roles are swapped... Humans have got weapons, have got brains and you (zombie) must survive in human's world. That's my first game so I must make this game smaller so... This will not open world, but this will be instantiated game with base as your hub.

### Core mechanics

First core mechanic is eating humans for repleinish your hunger and heal yourself.

Second is evolving, while you eating people you gain experience points, after level up you can unclock new mutations.

Third is building your base.

Fourth is going to small locations, because to build your base and to evolving you need resources and eat people.

### Story

I didn't for now thinking about it so for now I focus on make good mechanics. After that I'll make good plot.

## About world

### Locations

World will be divided to small instances. On each map you can find people, buildings and some resources for building your base and improve your gear (maybe I'm not sure about that idea).

On the all levels you must find as many resources as you can, eat that many people how many you need. But you must be aware about time... After some time army detect you and send commandos (I'm not sure about that idea).
